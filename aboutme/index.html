    <p>Howdy yall (real southerners don't spell "ya'll" with an apostraphe), pictured is me with my son Bazzi.
    I'm from a moderate-sized town just 
    outside of Nashville Tennessee. I'm pursuing a degree in CIT with the hopes of landing a job that's either
    easy or fun with high pay. I was origionally studying exercise phys to become a personal trainer. After
    about three semesters here I realized I didn't need a degree for that and dropped out. I spent several
    years following that career path and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I didn't like how my income
    capped out at a certain point, and how I also basically had to be a salesman to get clients. Anyways, after
    some time and due to some specific life events, I felt led to come back to school and decided that this was
    the career path I wanted to pursue.</p>
    <p>I am single (you're welcome, ladies) {I say that like there's more than 3 in the course lol}, and looking 
    for activities/groups to join around campus. My hobbies are all over the place. I enjoy most of the arts
    (music, books, art-art, occasionally dancing), as well as working out, ultimate frisbee, and a handful of 
    games.</p>
    <p>If I'm being honest, I signed up for this class because it was required for my major. However, after
    seeing the course work and everything we're covering I'm actully pretty excited to learn more about web
    development. One of my hobbies is writing novels and I'd love to be able to build my own webpage for my
    books one day. I'm excited to get to know many of you better and build some connections with others in
    the tech field!</p>
