As a heads up, in order to get this last one to work i had to delete the top 2. I got the first one right except I forgot the <!DOCTYPE html>
The second one I totally bombed.
This third one I couldn't remember a thing. I looked at my other one's to do it. I know that wasn't allowed but I figured it would be better to try and refresh this stuff in my mind instead of staring blankly at my screen for 20 minutes
