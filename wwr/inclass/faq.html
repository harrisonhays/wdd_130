            <button class="accordion">Are all of the amenities all inclusive?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Absolutely! When you purchase a ticket with Dry Oar your entire stay is all inclusive. The only thing that changes between packages is the cabin you will be staying at and the number of days you plan to spend at our resort. All amenities (rentals, rafting, bar, spa, lounge, taxi survice) come with your purchase already!</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Where exactly is dry oar located?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>That's a great question! Seeing as how our all-inclusive, state of the art, luxury resort is fictitious, it is only located in your dreams! Good luck ever getting here in person. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What kind of pricing should I expect?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>As this is a rediculously fancy experience, as with all overly-priced things you'll have to call and talk to one of our booking agents to find out! Obviously pricing will depend on where, when, and how long you want to stay, but good luck getting a ballpark estimate from the information available on this website!</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Why is there a bar on amember-designed website?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>That's because the website designer wanted to create a rediculously over the top experience catering to the wealthiest of the wealthy. When he imagines the 1% of the 1% he imagines cocktail parties and suits straight out of the movies.</p>
